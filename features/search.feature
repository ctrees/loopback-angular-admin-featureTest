  In order to see a word definition
  As a website user
  I need to be able to search for a word

#  Scenario: Searching for a page that does exist
#    Given I am on "/#/login"
#    When I fill in "search" with "Behavior Driven Development"
#    And I press "searchButton"
#    Then I should see "software development process"

#  Scenario: Searching for a page that does NOT exist
#    Given I am on "/wiki/Main_Page"
#    When I fill in "search" with "Glory Driven Development"
#    And I press "searchButton"
#    Then I should see "Search results"

#  @javascript
#  Scenario: Searching for a page with autocompletion
#    Given I am on "/#/login"
#    Then I wait for angular
#    Then I should see text matching "Sign In"
#    And I should see text matching "Email"
#    And I should see text matching "Password"
#    When I fill in "search" with "Behavior Driv"
#    And I wait for the suggestion box to appear
#    Then I should see "Behavior-Driven Development"
